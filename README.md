This is an annotaed implementation of `selective_scan_cuda` from Mamba. This is not a runnable code, but a reference for what is going on in the CUDA kernel. I wrote this in python for people who don't know c++. There are 
some slight difference's between the python and c++ code, but the general idea is the same.

Additionally, I write comments in the code to explain what is going on and why they choose to do some things. I basic understanding of what a CUDA kernel is would be helpful, though you can still get the general idea of what is going on without it.
